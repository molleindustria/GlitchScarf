GlitchScarf is a playful performance and a system to mess with knitting patterns in real time. Design or glitch a scarf as itâ€™s being made, wear your artful errors with pride!

The project is a collaboration with Tenley Schmida. It was for the most part developed during a 3-day game jam at the [Carnegie Mellon University Textiles Lab](https://textiles-lab.github.io/).
This is possibly the only software that allows the creation of knitting patterns on the fly, as opposed to feeding a machine with a static image.

GlitchScarf was made in Processing, it interfaces with the [AYAB (All Yarns Are Beautiful) board](https://ayab-knitting.com/features/), an arduino powered hack for semi-electronic knitting machines.
It was only tested with a Brother KH910.
